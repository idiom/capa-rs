//! Error types and handling for the dotscope library.
//!
//! This module defines the comprehensive error handling system for the dotscope library,
//! providing detailed error types for .NET assembly parsing, metadata analysis, and
//! disassembly operations. The error types are designed to provide meaningful context
//! for different failure modes to enable appropriate error handling and debugging.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The error system is built around a single comprehensive [`crate::Error`] enum that
//! covers all possible error conditions. This approach provides a unified error handling
//! experience while maintaining detailed error categorization. The system includes:
//!
//! - Structured error variants for different failure modes
//! - Source location tracking for malformed file errors
//! - Integration with external library errors through automatic conversion
//! - Thread-safe error propagation for concurrent operations
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! ## Core Types
//! - [`crate::Error`] - Main error enum covering all possible error conditions
//! - [`crate::Result`] - Convenience type alias for `Result<T, Error>`
//!
//! ## Error Categories
//! - **File Parsing Errors**: Invalid offsets, malformed data, out-of-bounds access
//! - **I/O Errors**: Filesystem operations, permission issues
//! - **Type System Errors**: Type registration, resolution, and conversion failures
//! - **Analysis Errors**: Recursion limits, synchronization failures, dependency graph issues
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ## Basic Error Handling
//!
//! ```rust
//! use dotscope::{Error, Result};
//!
//! fn parse_data() -> Result<String> {
//!     // Function that might fail
//!     Err(Error::NotSupported)
//! }
//!
//! match parse_data() {
//!     Ok(data) => println!("Success: {}", data),
//!     Err(Error::NotSupported) => println!("Feature not supported"),
//!     Err(e) => println!("Other error: {}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Advanced Error Handling
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use dotscope::{Error, metadata::cilobject::CilObject};
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! match CilObject::from_path(Path::new("assembly.dll")) {
//!     Ok(assembly) => {
//!         println!("Successfully loaded assembly");
//!     }
//!     Err(Error::NotSupported) => {
//!         eprintln!("File format is not supported");
//!     }
//!     Err(Error::Malformed { message, file, line }) => {
//!         eprintln!("Malformed file: {} ({}:{})", message, file, line);
//!     }
//!     Err(Error::Io(io_err)) => {
//!         eprintln!("I/O error: {}", io_err);
//!     }
//!     Err(e) => {
//!         eprintln!("Other error: {}", e);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Using the Malformed Error Macro
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use dotscope::malformed_error;
//!
//! fn validate_header(size: usize) -> dotscope::Result<()> {
//!     if size < 4 {
//!         return Err(malformed_error!("Header too small: {} bytes", size));
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! All error types in this module are thread-safe. The [`crate::Error`] enum implements
//! [`std::marker::Send`] and [`std::marker::Sync`], allowing errors to be safely passed
//! between threads and shared across thread boundaries. This enables proper error
//! propagation in concurrent parsing and analysis operations.
//!
