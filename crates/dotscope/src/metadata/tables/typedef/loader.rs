//! # `TypeDef` Table Loader
//!
//! This module provides loading functionality for the `TypeDef` metadata table (ID 0x02).
//! The `TypeDef` table is the primary table for type definitions within a .NET assembly,
//! containing all types (classes, interfaces, enums, structs, delegates) defined in
//! the current assembly. This is one of the most critical tables in the metadata system.
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! The `TypeDef` table serves as the foundation for type system operations:
//! - **Type Definitions**: Contains all types defined within the assembly
//! - **Type Hierarchy**: Establishes inheritance relationships and type structure
//! - **Member Organization**: Links types to their fields, methods, properties, and events
//! - **Metadata Integration**: Provides the core structure for the entire type system
//!
//! ## Loading Process
//!
//! 1. **Detection**: Checks if `TypeDef` table exists in metadata header
//! 2. **Parallel Phase 1**: Loads type definitions in parallel without base type resolution
//! 3. **String Resolution**: Resolves type names from the string heap
//! 4. **Member Linking**: Establishes connections to fields and methods
//! 5. **Type System Integration**: Registers types in the global type registry
//! 6. **Parallel Phase 2**: Resolves base types in parallel after all types are loaded
//! 7. **Validation**: Validates type structure and inheritance relationships
//!
//! ## Dependencies
//!
//! - **Field Table**: Required for field member resolution
//! - **`FieldPtr` Table**: Required for field indirection resolution
//! - **`MethodDef` Table**: Required for method member resolution
//! - **`MethodPtr` Table**: Required for method indirection resolution
//! - **`TypeRef` Table**: Required for base type and interface resolution
//!
//! ## Type System Integration
//!
//! `TypeDef` entries are integrated into the type system registry:
//! - **Global Registration**: Types are registered for cross-assembly access
//! - **Inheritance Chains**: Base type relationships are established
//! - **Generic Types**: Generic type definitions and constraints are processed
//! - **Nested Types**: Nested type relationships are maintained
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//!
//! The loader uses thread-safe storage mechanisms for concurrent access to
//! type definitions across multiple threads during metadata loading.
//!
//! ## References

/// Loader implementation for the `TypeDef` metadata table.
///
/// This loader processes `TypeDef` table entries (ID 0x02) that define all types
/// within the current assembly. It handles the loading, resolution, and integration
/// of type definitions with the broader metadata type system, establishing the
/// foundation for all type-related operations.
///
/// ## Loading Strategy
///
/// The loader employs a comprehensive type processing approach:
/// - Iterates through all `TypeDef` entries in declaration order
/// - Resolves type names and namespaces from string heap
/// - Links types to their field and method members
/// - Handles field and method pointer indirection when present
/// - Integrates types into the global type system registry
/// - Validates type structure and member relationships
///
/// ## Type Processing
///
/// Each type definition undergoes complete processing:
/// - **Name Resolution**: Type and namespace names from string heap
/// - **Member Linking**: Fields and methods are associated with the type
/// - **Hierarchy Setup**: Base types and interfaces are resolved
/// - **Generic Processing**: Generic parameters and constraints are handled
/// - **Attribute Processing**: Custom attributes are parsed and associated
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// The loader validates:
/// - Type definition structure and format
/// - Type name validity and uniqueness
/// - Member relationship consistency
/// - Generic parameter constraints and bounds
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This loader is thread-safe and integrates with thread-safe type system
/// storage for concurrent access during metadata loading operations.
