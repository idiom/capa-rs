//! Conflict resolution strategies for assembly modification operations.
//!
//! This module provides conflict resolution strategies for handling conflicting operations
//! during assembly modification. When multiple operations target the same metadata
//! element, resolvers determine which operation should take precedence.
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! - [`LastWriteWinsResolver`] - Default conflict resolver using timestamp ordering
//! - [`ConflictResolver`] - Trait for implementing custom resolution strategies
//! - [`Conflict`] - Types of conflicts that can occur during modification
//! - [`Resolution`] - Conflict resolution results
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The conflict resolution system is built around pluggable strategies that can be
//! configured based on application requirements:
//!
//! ## Timestamp-Based Resolution
//! The default [`LastWriteWinsResolver`] uses operation timestamps to determine
//! precedence, with later operations overriding earlier ones.
//!
//! ## Extensible Design
//! The [`ConflictResolver`] trait allows custom resolution strategies
//! to be implemented for specific use cases.
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crate::cilassembly::resolver::{LastWriteWinsResolver, ConflictResolver, Conflict};
//!
//! // Create a resolver
//! let resolver = LastWriteWinsResolver;
//!
//! // Resolve conflicts (typically used by validation pipeline)
//! // let conflicts = vec![/* conflicts */];
//! // let resolution = resolver.resolve_conflict(&conflicts)?;
//! # Ok::<(), crate::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! This type is [`Send`] and [`Sync`] as it contains no mutable state and operates
//! purely on the input data.

/// Trait for conflict resolution strategies.
///
/// Different applications may need different conflict resolution strategies:
/// - **Last-write-wins (default)**: Most recent operation takes precedence
/// - **First-write-wins**: First operation takes precedence
/// - **Merge operations**: Combine compatible operations
/// - **Reject on conflict**: Fail validation on any conflict
///
/// Conflict resolution is essential for handling scenarios where multiple
/// operations target the same resource, ensuring deterministic behavior
/// and maintaining assembly integrity.
///
/// # Implementation Guidelines
///
/// Conflict resolvers should:
/// - Be deterministic and consistent
/// - Handle all conflict types appropriately
/// - Provide clear resolution decisions
/// - Be configurable for different use cases
/// - Maintain operation ordering guarantees
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use crate::cilassembly::resolver::{ConflictResolver, Conflict, Resolution};
///
/// struct LastWriteWinsResolver;
///
/// impl ConflictResolver for LastWriteWinsResolver {
///     fn resolve_conflict(&self, conflicts: &[Conflict]) -> Result<Resolution> {
///         let mut resolution = Resolution::default();
///         for conflict in conflicts {
///             // Resolve by choosing the latest operation
///             // Implementation details...
///         }
///         Ok(resolution)
///     }
/// }
